Solution:
java -jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=C:\Progra~1\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\jre\lib\security\cacert -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit jenkins.war
didnt work.

-Cacerts file (java_home/jre/lib/sercurity/cacerts) : its collection of trusted CA (certificate authority) 
certificates. VeriSign is a certificate authority.
-The essential requirement is that the certificate authority that signed the Service Manager server’s 
certificate must be in the list of certificate authorities named in this file. 
-certificates can be seen using 'keytool' utility.
-To use a self-issued server certificate created with OpenSSL or a tool such as Microsoft Certificate Server™, 
you must import the certificate for this private certificate authority into the cacerts file that 
the client uses for SSL.
