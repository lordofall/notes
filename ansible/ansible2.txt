Cobbler - a configuration management tool.
Func - a tool for communicating commands to remote server

For configuration management, there are various tools being used like Puppet, Chef, cfengine.
For server deployment - Capistrano, Fabric
For ad-hoc task execution - Func, plain SSH

So all these three (configuration management, server deployment and task execution) are wrapped in one tool, called ansible.

-----
If you want ansible on windows, use Linux virtual machine. Or configure Cygwin environment.

1----
how to install ansible
$ sudo pip install ansible

to upgrade ansible
$ pip install --upgrade ansible


On Fedora-like system, use yum package.
On Redhat or Centos, you need to install EPEL's RPM before you install ansible.

2-----
to find out free memory of all machines under group 'example'

$ ansible example -a "free -m" -u [username]

to find out disk usage statistics
$ ansible example -a "df -h" -u [username]

3-------------VAGRANT-------------------------------
vagrant, a server provisioning tool and virtual box, a local virtualization environment.
vagrant is an amazing tool for managing virtual machines via a simple command line interface.  With a simple 'vagrant up' you can be working in a clean environment based on a standard template. These standard templates are called base boxes. here, on this site http://www.vagrantbox.es/, you can find 
download boxes for different OS. so using virtualization environment (like VMWare virtualbox, vagrant-LXC, KVM), vagrant manages the virtual machines. 

before installing vagrant and virtual box, 157 GB free 
virtualbox - 168 MB
vagrant - 209 MB

download centos box and start the machine using vagrant
https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-addinstall-and-run-centos-7-vagrant-box-to-virtualbox-using-vagrant/

$ vagrant box add envimation/ubuntu-xenial https://atlas.hashicorp.com/envimation/boxes/ubuntu-xenial
add a centos virtual box using vagrant:
$ vagrant box add geerlingguy/centos7

create default virtual server configuration using:
$ vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7

boot your centos server up
$ vagrant up

so far, vagrant loaded the centos server, loaded it into virtual box with the configuration defined in the default vagrant file
and booted the server up. Thus vagrant is a provisioning tool which provides the server, those servers run inside virtual box.

stop server
$ vagrant halt

delete the machine from virtual box
$ vargrant destroy

running server (in the virtual box) can be connected via ssh
go to folder where Vagrantfile is located and do following:
$ vagrant ssh

to get ssh config details:
$ vagrant ssh-config

you can install vagrant plugin as well from command prompt. 
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
