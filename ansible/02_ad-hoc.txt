after creating three servers(centos), now let the ansible know about these servers.
go to folder (containing Vagrantfile) which has the server with ansible installed.
$ vagrant ssh
$ ansible --version
$ sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
$ sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts

copy following in hosts file:
# ---------------------------
# Lines beginning with a # are comments, and are only included for
# illustration. These comments are overkill for most inventory files.

# Application servers
[app]
192.168.60.4
192.168.60.5

# Database server
[db]
192.168.60.6

# Group 'multi' with all servers
[multi:children]
app
db

# Variables that will be applied to all servers
[multi:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=vagrant
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
# ------------------ 

run following to get host name from all target servers (two app and one db as mentioned above in hosts file)
$ ansible multi -a "hostname"
error: Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Host key verification failed
