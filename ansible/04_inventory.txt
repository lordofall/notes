inventory file is usually located at /etc/ansible/hosts
this hosts file can be .ini file or .yaml file. But one must be consistent with the namings.

inventories i.e. host or target servers can be arranged in logical groups like databases or webservers. One host/target server can be part of several 
groups. 
two default groups are 'all' and 'ungrouped'.

For each groups we can also mention variables. For example, to connect to all database servers, specific user and password is created for ansible. 
that cn be mentioned in vars. 

we can also have nested groups , in [windows_servers: children]  $ ansible windows_servers -m win_ping

####
[webservers]
web01
web02

[databases]
host1
host2

[windows_servers: children]
webservers
databases

[databases: vars]
ansible_username=asdasdfsadf
ansible_password=asdasdfsadf


---------------

to connect to linux system, either you provide username password everytime or create ssh key.
$ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "q4465@qk.com"
it will generate public private rsa key pair. copy the public key to target host.

$ssh-copy-id -i /home/q4465/.ssh/id_rsa.pub q4465@lnhost1

now change the host file where it will contain the private key.

[linuxhost]
lnhost1

[linuxhost: vars]
ansible_user="q4465"
ansible_private_key_file=/home/q4465/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_connection=ssh
