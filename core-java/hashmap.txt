Internal of hash map.
--------------------

-Hashmap is array of nodes. 
-A node contains following:
1) hex 2) K key 3) V value 4) Node next

- In hashmap, key is unique. it can be null as well.

- Hashcode funcion of the key (Key is a class) is used to find the index of the array where the node will be put. 

- Equals function is used to check whether keys are equal or not.

If you override equals method, you must override hashcode as well. why ? lets says there is a class Employess.
equals method is overriden in such a way that if name and id is same, object is same. 
We must override hashcode in similar fashin, i.e. if name and id is same, hashcode of two objects must be same. 
then only, they will have same index in the array and then it will check whether any key already present is equal or not.
if equals, the node wont be added in the map.

Now think if hashcode is not overridden. Then a scenario is possible where two objects are equal (name and id is same); but their hashcode 
is different. so they will have different index. so duplicate keys can be inserted. Hashmap will behave erratically.
