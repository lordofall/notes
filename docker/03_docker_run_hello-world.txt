Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

 ##hello-world image is fetched and it is run as container
 
 ###############################
 step 1: docker run hello-world
 Installing docker gives you the client and daemon.
 client make API calls to daemon to run the container.
 Daemon implements the Docker Remote API. 
 It searches the hello-world image so that it can run the container. doesnt find it locally. so it goes to docker hub (http://hub.docker.com) which default public registry. so daemon gets the image of hello-world, saves in the local image store and then run the container. so daemin will pull those images that it doesnt already have.
