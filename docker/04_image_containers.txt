---------
>docker run -d --name web -p 80:8080 nigelpolon/pluralsight-docker-ci

## -d says, run in the detached mode. not in this terminal.

>docker run -it --name temp ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
## -it means interactive. that is, run it here. it will run ubuntu bash here.

so it will give me bash prompt. and this ubuntu has just one process running and that is bash.
so if you execute command, exit. it will stop the container too. 
so Ctrl P+Q, you will come out of the container to docker prompt .

>docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
to stop all containers which are running. 
docker ps -aq => means list all containers quietly.
--

>docker rm  (removes stopped containers)
