>docker-compose up -d
it will check docker-compose.yml file and according create the hub and nodes and node will be registered to hub.
sample yml file looks like following:
hub:
    image: selenium/hub
    ports:
        - "4444:4444"
firefox:
    image: selenium/node-firefox
    links:
        - hub
chrome:
    image: selenium/node-chrome
    links:
        - hub

so it will create a hub and two nodes for firefox and chrome each. suppose we want to scale the number of nodes containing firefox to 3.
Following command:
>docker-compose scale firefox=3
