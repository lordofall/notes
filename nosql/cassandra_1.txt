apache cassandra is column-oriented database.
NoSQL databases are schema-less unlike RDBMS.
implements dynamo-style replication model with no single point of failure.
highly scalable - add more hardware to serve more user and accomodate more data.
no single point of failure so it is continuously available.
it increases your throughput if you increase the nodes in the cluster.
cassandra supports ACID(atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Usually nosql are only consistent and there is no transaction support. But cassandra has transaction support.
Cassandra has peer-to-peer distribution system across nodes and data is distributed among all clusters in the node.
All the nodes in the cluster play the same role. Eash node is independent and at the same time interconnected with other nodes. each nodes supports read/write operation. If one node goes down, requests can be served by other nodes.
So one node receives the write-request, after writing the data, it replicates to its neighbors and they in turn do the same so same data is replicated in all nodes in the cluster.
cassandra uses "gossip protocol" in the backgroud and communicate with each other and detect any faulty node in the cluster.

-----components of cassandra-------
Node: where data is stored
Data centre: collection of related nodes
cluster: contains one or more data centre
Commit log: crash recovery mechanism. all write operations are written in commit log.
Mem-tables: in memory data strucure. after commit log is written, data is stored in these mem-tables.
SSTable: whem mem-tables reaches its threshold, data is written here. it is disk file.
Bloom filter: (i didnt understand)

-----------------------------------
Cassandra Query Language - CQL
CQL treats the database (Keyspaces) as container of tables. !!!???
Client can approach any node for read-write operation. That node acts as proxy between client and the node holding the data.
