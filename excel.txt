excel:

status bar at footer
overtype
----------------
absoulte reference & named reference
there is cell B3 where I have put a value which is used as multipiler.
in any cell, we write formula =C5*B3
if we use autofill downward, we will get
C6*B4
C7*B5

but our goal is to keep B3 in all the formulas.
so, =C5*$B$3 
$B$3 is absolute reference
so now B3 wont change.

there is another way. rename the B3 to 'multiplier' and it can be used as a variable in entire workbook. 
This 'multiplier' is named reference.
