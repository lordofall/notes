functions start with def.
example:

def square(x):
    return x*x

----

now we write a python file with one function. it won't call itself.

special attributes in python are delimited by double underscores.
eg. __name__

python runtime system defines some special variables which are delimited by double underscores. like __name__, __main__


so when we run python script from REPL, print(__name__) prints the module name. words.
>>>import words
words
if we run the same script from command line, like following, then it prints __main__
$ python words.py
__main__

---------
to get command line argument:
"url = sys.argv[1]"
and to use this, must "import sys"

see argparse library for getting input arguments from user. 

----document your code -----
docstring is the factility to document python code. 
docstring is between triple quotes, like following
    """ Fetch a list of words from the url.
    example url: http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt
    
    Args: 
        url: The url of a UTF-8 text document
        
    Returns: 
        A list of strings containing the words 
        from the document.
    """
  
now in REPL, you can get the help of this method
>>> from words impirt fetch_words
>>> help(fetch_words)

----comment your code---------
