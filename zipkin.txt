---------Spring sleuth----------------
Sleuth enhances log. It adds unique trace id  for all the web requests that enter our application.  Trace can be thought of like a single request or job. span can be thought of as  sections of a job.
So one trace  can be composed of multiple spans.

add  following dependency:
    <dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
    </dependency>

also add one property:
spring.application.name=qcp

all lines in log will be prefixed by following:
[-,45f374e69bbac69d,45f374e69bbac69d,false]

total 4 entries: 1st is for application name, 
second: trace id
third: span id
fourth: whether export to zipkin

-----zipkin---------------------
zipkin is the log aggregator.  used for distributed tracing.

1) create spring boot application
2) add dependencies zipkin-server and zipkin-autoconfigure-ui , spring-boot-starter-web
3) In spring boot main class, add annotation @EnableZipkinServer along with @SpringBootApplication
